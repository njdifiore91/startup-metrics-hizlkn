### **1.2 Data Viewing Options**

The platform supports two primary modes of data interaction:

1. **Direct Benchmark Exploration**

   - Users can freely browse all benchmark data by clicking through menu categories. If they click a category and then a metric the chart with benchmarks is display for the given Revenue range. So you select on top the revenue range you want metrics for, then you go to the categories let say  expenses, and then you click G&A as percent of revenue and you see several charts of the benchmarks for that revenue range from the different sources available for that source

   - They can view comprehensive benchmark charts, compare across different sources, and explore various revenue ranges.

2. **Personalized Comparison Mode**

   - Users can input their own company metrics for direct comparison against benchmarks.

   - Data entry is optional for each metric. But it will allow user to see just relevant metrics to them and not for other revenue ranges for example.

   - Visual comparisons are shown immediately.

   - A toggle lets users switch between personal (their own data) and general (industry benchmark) views.

   - Company data can be stored (with user permission) and can be exported for personalized reports.

3. Ability to reset search

   - Opportunity to click button to re-set and start new search
